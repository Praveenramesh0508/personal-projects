# Project Name: Sentiment Analysis using Binary Logistic Regression from Scratch

The goal of this assignment was to implement a Natural Language Processing (NLP) system using binary logistic regression, without relying on any existing libraries. The algorithm aimed to determine whether a restaurant review was positive or negative. The dataset used for this project was obtained from Yelp.

## Key Components of the Project

1. **Data preprocessing**: Raw restaurant reviews were converted into a format suitable for the logistic regression model. Each review consisted of a label (0 for negative reviews and 1 for positive ones) and a set of words.
2. **Feature engineering**: Variable-length textual data was transformed into fixed-length real-valued vectors using a word embeddings model. This process involved writing a program called feature.py, which generated real-valued vectors for each training, validation, and test example.
3. **Binary logistic regression**: Logistic regression was implemented from scratch, including functions for calculating the sigmoid, gradient descent, and cost function. This was achieved using a program called lr.py, which took the feature vectors generated by feature.py as input and trained the logistic regression model to predict the sentiment of each review.
4. **Model evaluation**: The performance of the logistic regression model was assessed using various evaluation metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

This project showcased the ability to create a machine learning algorithm from the ground up, providing a deep understanding of the underlying concepts and methodologies involved in binary logistic regression and NLP techniques.
