# Project Name: Blockchain for Distributed Systems

## Description
Blockchain Distributed Systems was a project focused on demonstrating the fundamental distinction between functional and non-functional characteristics of distributed systems, with an emphasis on the tamper-evident design of blockchain technology. The project consisted of two main tasks: creating a stand-alone blockchain (Part 1) and developing a distributed system where a remote client interacted with a blockchain API (Part 2).

### Part 1: Stand-alone Blockchain
This part involved the creation of a basic blockchain with several functionalities:

1. Viewing basic blockchain status.
2. Adding transactions to the blockchain.
3. Verifying the integrity of the blockchain.
4. Viewing the blockchain's content.
5. Introducing corruption to the chain.
6. Repairing the chain to hide corruption.

### Part 2: Distributed System with Blockchain API
This part focused on building a distributed system that allowed remote clients to interact with the blockchain API.
