# Project Name: Binary Decision Tree Classifier from Scratch

The objective of this project was to implement a binary decision tree classifier from scratch, without relying on any existing libraries. The classifier was applied to two different tasks: predicting whether a patient has heart disease and forecasting the final grade for high school students. Two programs, `inspection.py` and `decision_tree.py`, were developed as part of the project.

## Key Components

1. **Data preprocessing**: Handled missing values, categorical variables, and split the dataset into training and testing sets.
2. **Decision tree algorithm**: Implemented the decision tree algorithm from scratch, including features such as node splitting, entropy calculations, and information gain.
3. **Model evaluation**: Assessed the performance of the decision tree classifier using various evaluation metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
4. **Experimentation**: Ran end-to-end experiments on both tasks (heart disease prediction and high school grade forecasting) and reported the results.

The project demonstrated the ability to create a machine learning algorithm from the ground up, providing a deep understanding of the underlying concepts and methodologies involved in decision tree classifiers.
