# Project Name: MovieMate - Android App with Analytics Powered Using MongoDB and Custom WebServer

## Description
MovieMate was an Android application designed to provide users with movie information and personalized recommendations based on their preferred genres. When searching for a movie, the app displayed relevant details, including the movie title, overview, release date, and official poster. For movie suggestions, the app presented a selection from the specified genre, complete with its poster, title, and average rating.

The project consisted of five components:

1. **Android Application**: A user-friendly interface for users to search for movies and receive recommendations.
2. **Java WebServlet**: A web service responsible for handling user requests and fetching movie information. This servlet was deployed on the Codespace cloud using Docker for seamless scalability.
3. **Third-party API**: An external API utilized to fetch movie data and generate personalized recommendations based on user preferences.
4. **Dashboard**: A comprehensive platform for operational analytics, leveraging MongoDB logs to monitor and optimize app performance.
5. **MongoDB Atlas**: A cloud-based storage solution for storing and managing application data, facilitating efficient retrieval and analysis.

MovieMate offered a convenient and personalized movie discovery experience, combining an intuitive Android application with a scalable web service, a powerful third-party API, and robust data storage and analytics capabilities.
